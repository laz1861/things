This is a buildlog for the modified perseverance 3D printed item.

I first tried printing the base.  It was printed in three pieces due to its height.  It took
forever and wasted a tremendous amount of plastic for support material.  I decided to redesign
the part to have the base be a three-piece laser cut item.  Our laser cutter (Goldfinger) is
great at cutting 3 mm thick material.  

Phase 1:
I took measurements from the included assembly.skp to get an exact layout of the base item.
I rounded dimensions to the nearest 0.1mm.  The base cut out very well.  An unanticipated
side effect of the laser cut base was that the holes were oversized.  An unexpected benefit is
that the system can be partially assembled before assembling the base.  This results in a much
simpler assembly.

In retrospect, this is obvious.  A 3D printer tends to undersize holes, while a laser cutter
will oversize holes due to the kerf.

I had to re-design the axle bearings for the gears so that they would accomodate both the 
larger hole diameters and the smaller thickness for the base walls. Additionally, there was an 
error in the stl file for the idle input wheel.  It was based on the axle bearing, so I redesigned
the parts in OpenSCAD.

After printing the parts, the fit was much tighter.  However, I didn't allow for proper 
clearances between the male and female parts. With the additional forces, the small registration
pin size became an issue.  It should be made as large as practical. A redesign was in order.
