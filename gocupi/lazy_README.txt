I don't like printing with support material, so none of my models require you to use support.
That being said I have a pretty nice printer: http://www.polyprinter.com/polyprinter-229/
which can print all of my models without support...YMMV depending on equipment and slicing and 
all the other variables.

If you don't have access to a printer, I believe the folks at PolyPrinter also offer printing 
service which you can find at www.polyprinter.com/services/

All of the folders include a readme file specific to the parts within the folder, I suggest you 
read them all since I took time out of my precious day to write them.

Cheers,
