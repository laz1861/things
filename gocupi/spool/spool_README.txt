The spool is wider than originally planned due to suction cup issues which affected everything else once fixed.
This put the motors farther away from the drawing surface which was a problem, so to get the string closer to the drawing
surface the spool is much thicker/wider than previous versions. Rather than just design in an extended shaft I put 
a 50mm diameter spool on the reverse side along with set screw cutouts for the string and the shaft on both sides.
