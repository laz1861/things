The motor mounts are designed for NEMA 17s with a flange mounting bracket (part of the motor).
If you are not using motors that you got with your gocupi setup then chances are you will need 
to print adapters for each mount, OR learn solidworks and modify the model :)

Print:
1	motorMountRight
1	motorMountLeft

perhaps 2 motorMountAdapters
